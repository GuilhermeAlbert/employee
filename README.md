For installation of laravel, you first have to have the composer on your machine, if you can not download an executable from it and install the composer without too much trouble on your machine.

Click on the link to download:

```shell 
https://getcomposer.org/
```

With the composer on your Windows machine, we will install our utility, the Laravel Installer. First open your command prompt, just use the key combination `CTRL + R` and in the window that appears enter: `cmd`. After that press `ENTER` to open the prompt.

With the prompt open, type and execute the command below:

```shell 
composer global require "laravel/installer"
```

To access the application files, you need to download the repository in GitHub.


## Project installation

Perform cloning of the repository through GitHub:

```shell 
git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeAlbert/employee.git
```

Navigate through the folders on your computer until you reach the cloned folder:

```shell 
cd employee
```

Use the *composer* to perform the installation:

```shell 
composer install
```

Use the Node package Manager to install dependencies:

```shell 
npm install
```

You will need to configure the `.env` file for the project by setting the connection values to the database and if necessary, creating a new hash key.

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

```shell
php artisan key:generate
```

## Creating database:
Create the database in your MySQL database manager environment:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE employee;
```

Use migrations to create the database tables:

```shell
php artisan migrate
```

Run all database factory fake data:

```shell
php artisan db:seed
```

Run this command to install passport auth:

```shell
php artisan passport:install
```

## Starting server
Start displaying the application from the server:

```shell
php artisan serve
```

If everything is correct, when running `php artisan serve` in the terminal, something like:

```
